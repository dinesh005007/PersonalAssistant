1. This Deep neural network chat bot helps in understanding more about me.
2. The chat bot is build using tensorflow and tflearn library.
3. We made use of NLP in processing the inputs given by the user and the neural network for defining which response should be given to the user from the predefined.
4. In order to run the program, first you need to install all the required dependencies which are specified in the requirements.txt file in your virtual environment(Anaconda). Note:I have tried in python latest version which doesnt seems to work due to some dependency conflicts. So i used python3.6 stable version.)
5. Then fork or copy the model.py file and run it.
6. Once when you run it, in the output terminal you need to input your query or question which will then be processed and using the neural network the output will be displayed.
7. We can make the chatbot answer the user questions continuosly using a FOR loop with break statement.

I understand you would be having many questions,This will be a updatable program, So please hit up my gmail(dinesh005007@gmail.com) with all your questions and Sugesstions.
